The Cambridgeshire Repeater Group (CRG) owns and operates amateur radio analogue voice repeaters around Cambridgeshire, in the East of England.

Our repeaters are based at three sites: Barkway, near Royston; Madingley, just west of Cambridge; and Washingley, near Peterborough. These repeaters serve users in the Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, North East Hertfordshire, North West Essex, West Suffolk and South West Norfolk areas.

They include FM voice repeaters on 6m, 2m, 70cm and 23cm, digital voice repeaters covering D-STAR, DMR, and Yaesu System Fusion, APRS digipeaters, and a digital televsion repeater on 23cm.

The CRG hold the callsigns G3PYE and G6PYE which are used to help promote the group on-air. More information, including the history of the CRG can be found on the About the CRG page.
