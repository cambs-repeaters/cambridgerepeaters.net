The Cambridgeshire Repeater Group and Camb-Hams aim to create a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment where all participants feel welcome.

We expect anyone using our repeaters, mailing lists, or attending our events, to honour this Code of Conduct.

We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of our members, volunteers, or other spectrum users.

We welcome people regardless of age, gender, culture, race, religion, sexual orientation, physical and technical ability.

Communication both on air and online should be appropriate for a broad audience, including people of many different backgrounds and experiences.

We expect people to respect each other, and each other's interests, and not act in a way that lessens the pleasure of others.

We reserve the right to take any action that we deem appropriate, including removing any participants who violate this Code of Conduct from our events and mailing lists, and prohibiting attendance at future events.

You can report any concerns, harassment or discriminatory behavior, or suspicious or disruptive activity (whether directed towards you or somebody else) to any CRG committee member.
