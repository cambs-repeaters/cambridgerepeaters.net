Running and developing a fleet of repeaters can be an expensive business. The Cambridgeshire Repeater Group is a voluntary organisation that relies solely on the support of its members. Ordinary membership starts at £10 per annum, or a whole family can join for £15 per annum.

For those who'd like to give a little more, silver membership for £25 per annum helps us develop new repeaters and support the community activities of the Camb-Hams, our social side.

We'd love you to join us and help us in our work to provide a state-of-the-art repeater network for Cambridgeshire and the surrounding area.
