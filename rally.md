### Trader fees

#### In the hall

We only charge you for table space. Tables cost £12 each and are approximately 1830x685mm.

The quantity of tables for rent is limited and will be allocated in order of bookings received. Maximum 4 tables rental per trader.

If you bring your own tables, the cost will be £9 per table of equivalent size and there are no restrictions on number of tables. You *must* book indoor spaces at least 72 hours in advance as we plan the layout of the hall and tables based on your requirements.

If we run out of tables to rent, we will inform you and you may cancel your booking and receive a full refund. Alternatively, you may receive £3 per table refund on the day if you bring your own tables.

You may place boxes of goods under your tables but, to comply with fire regulations, it is strictly prohibited to place goods in the walking areas.

#### Car boot

The car boot space will be on the grass field, not in front of the Hall. Car boot trading pitches cost £6 per vehicle including a 3 meter wide pitch. 

Additional space per vehicle will be charged at £4 per 3 meter space. 

We appreciate you pre-booking your spaces, so that we can ensure there are sufficient pitches available for all traders.
