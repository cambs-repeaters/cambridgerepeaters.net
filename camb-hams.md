The Camb-Hams are the "social side" of the CRG. First formed in 2008, when a group of local repeater users decided to put faces to the callsigns at a local pub, the Camb-Hams have since developed into a wide-ranging group, taking part in contests, putting on special event stations, going on DXpeditions, and working with the RSGB to bring some of their events to a wider audience.

We meet informally on the first Wednesday of every month at the White Horse Inn, Milton (CB24 6AJ), from around 6pm - all are welcome to join us for something to eat and drink, as well as friendly chat, planning, and sharing of the latest acquisitions.

Online, we use a mailing list [over at Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/camb-hams/) and a Telegram group - reach out to one of us if you'd like to join either of these.

Other regular events through the year include:
- HF and VHF Field Days from the top of a local hill
- Operating the special event station GB2NHF at the National Hamfest
- Providing live streaming (alongside NARC) and recording of the RSGB Convention, as well as providing the special event station GB3HQ
- Team entries in the RSGB AFS Super League contest series
- Regular entries in the RSGB 80m Club Championship evening contests
- Trips to Ham Radio Friedricshfen in Germany and the Dutch Ham Radio Day at Rosmalen

We've also been active from the Scottish Isles as GS3PYE; more details on our dedicated site [dx.camb-hams.com](https://dx.camb-hams.com/).
